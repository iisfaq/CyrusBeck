[CyrusBeck line clipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus%E2%80%93Beck_algorithm) in c# - converted from C++ code at [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/line-clipping-set-2-cyrus-beck-algorithm/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/line-clipping-set-2-cyrus-beck-algorithm/)

Along with a sample application that shows the result of the line clipping

* DoesNotIntersect,
* NotTrimmed,
* StartTrimmed,
* EndTrimmed,
* StartAndEndTrimmed

This code resolves issues with the original c++ code for horizontal lines not returning correct results.
